# codyhxyz-plugins 🍋

*agentic scaffolding for thinking alongside LLMs.*

i build things constantly, things i deeply care about. along the way i keep finding little heuristics that work for me, and if they work for me they probably work for someone else too. so in the spirit of open-sourcing myself, i'm open-sourcing the heuristics as plugins. this is how i work with claude.

## available plugins

| Plugin | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`create-claude-plugin` 🛠️](https://github.com/codyhxyz/create-claude-plugin) | A claude plugin that ships claude plugins. Scaffold it, validate it, push it, submit it to the official Anthropic marketplace, all in one session. |
| [`prompt-optimizer` 🎯](https://github.com/codyhxyz/prompt-optimizer) | Fills in the implicit details in your vague prompt. Cuts token use and gets better results in the critical first conversational turn with Opus 4.7. |
| [`first-principles-review` 🔬](https://github.com/codyhxyz/first-principles-review) | A better code review. Less over-building, more delivering what you asked for. |
| [`eureka` ⚡](https://github.com/codyhxyz/eureka) | A subagent for when claude is trying all the wrong things. Use it when you need Claude to think outside the box. This is my #1 most helpful plugin for unblocking stuck coding sessions. |
| [`synonymmer` 📚](https://github.com/codyhxyz/synonymmer) | Thesaurus on steroids for naming and brainstorming. Outputs 100-200 latent-space-near words and phrases related to your seed term, organized into clusters. |

## why these exist

some of these are scaffolding for unhobbling the model. some are scaffolding for unhobbling yourself. a couple are just neat.

watch this space. i'm getting obsessed with claude plugins and starting to understand something about them, which is why i built [`create-claude-plugin`](https://github.com/codyhxyz/create-claude-plugin) in the first place — i knew i'd be shipping a lot of these.
